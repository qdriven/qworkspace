## fgit for quick github access

For some unkown reason, it is not stable to access github local. So use github proxy tool like fgit to access.
Here is a tool:

```sh
sudo curl -L https://github.com/fastgh/fgit/releases/download/v1.0.0/fgit.darwin -o /usr/local/bin/fgit
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/fgit
```
